# Specification Quality Checklist: Scoop Distribution Follow-On

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-05-01
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for the intended artifact audience
- [x] Governance context is explicit (mode, risk, scope, invariants)
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Non-goals are explicit
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] Validation plan separates generation from validation
- [x] Decision log seed exists
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- Validation pass completed on 2026-05-01 with no unresolved clarification markers.
- Explicit closeout expectations for version bump, impacted docs and changelog, Rust-file coverage, `cargo clippy`, and `cargo fmt` are preserved as first-class requirements for the generated task plan.
