- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- Validation completed on 2026-05-15 against roadmap S3, the Canon spec template, related Canon and Boundline contract specs, and a placeholder or clarification-marker scan.
- No unresolved issues were found in the first validation iteration.
- The spec keeps Canon on the semantic side of the boundary and records compatibility rules explicitly so downstream runtimes can fail closed.
