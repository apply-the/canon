# Canon Rust Language Rules

These rules are normative for Rust code changes in this repository. They are
part of the repository's AI-visible governance surface and apply to both human
and AI-authored changes.

## No Panic Outside Entrypoints And Tests

- In Rust code outside `main.rs`, `#[cfg(test)]` modules, and files under
  `tests/`, do not introduce panic-prone control flow.
- Treat `unwrap()`, `expect()`, `panic!()`, `todo!()`, `unimplemented!()`,
  `unreachable!()`, and assert-family macros used as runtime guards as banned
  outside `main.rs` and test code.
- When a failure can arise from repository state, user input, IO, parsing,
  serialization, validation, or mode dispatch, surface it with explicit error
  propagation or a typed blocked/unsupported state.
- `main.rs` may still panic when immediate process termination is the intended
  behavior of the executable entrypoint, but explicit exit handling remains
  preferred when practical.
- `#[cfg(test)]` code and files under `tests/` may use panicking helpers
  freely.

## No Magic Literals In Owned Logic

- In Rust code outside `main.rs`, `#[cfg(test)]` modules, and files under
  `tests/`, do not introduce magic strings or magic numbers in repository
  logic, mode dispatch, protocol handling, persistence, configuration, CLI
  contracts, or serialization paths.
- Promote reusable literals, wire-format keys, status strings, exit codes,
  schema versions, filenames, and sentinel numeric values into named `const`
  items or typed enums/newtypes scoped to the owning module or type.
- Prefer typed wrappers or enums when the literal represents a constrained
  domain value rather than a generic scalar.

## Typed Serialization For Stable Shapes

- When a serialized or deserialized shape is stable, model it with typed
  `struct` or `enum` definitions plus `serde` derives rather than assembling
  `serde_json::Map`, relying on repeated raw key strings, or constructing
  stable payloads with ad hoc `json!` objects.
- Use map- or value-oriented assembly only when the payload shape is genuinely
  dynamic or partially open-ended, and keep the dynamic boundary explicit in
  the owning type or function.

## Allowed Non-Panicking Helpers

- This rule does not ban non-panicking combinators such as
  `unwrap_or_default`, `unwrap_or_else`, `unwrap_or`, or `Option`/`Result`
  handling that returns explicit errors instead of panicking.

## Review Expectation

- Reviewers and implementers should treat newly introduced panic-prone calls
  outside `main.rs` and test code as policy violations.
- Reviewers and implementers should treat newly introduced magic literals or
  stable-shape ad hoc map/json serialization outside `main.rs` and test code
  as policy violations.

## Clean Code & Modularity

- **File Size and Responsibilities**: Do not generate gigantic monolithic files. Extract complex logic, internal algorithms, state transitions, and UI/CLI formatters into private helper modules (`pub(crate)` or private). Each file and module should have a single, cohesive responsibility.
- **Design Patterns**: Avoid massive inline match statements or monolithic functions. Use appropriate design patterns (e.g., Builder, Strategy, Dependency Injection, State Machine) and separate I/O from business logic.
- **Magic Strings and Numbers**: Zero tolerance for magic values. Every repeated string literal, timeout, retry count, or protocol boundary value must be extracted into a `const` or a typed `enum`.
- **Helpers**: Aim for <50 lines per function. Whenever a function exceeds this or you need a comment to explain the middle of a function, proactively extract the lower-level steps into isolated, well-named helper functions.
- **No Dead Code**: Remove all commented-out code, unused variables, and unreachable branches immediately. `git` remembers.
- **Why Not What**: Documentation and comments must explain the *why*, business constraints, and invariants, not narrate the *what*.
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Every module or folder must have a module-level doc comment (`//!` in the module file, e.g., `module.rs` or `mod.rs`) explaining the module's purpose. These docs MUST be kept up to date with code changes. Furthermore, all structs, enums, constants, and public functions must be documented with clear, up-to-date doc comments (`///`).
- **Logging & Secrets**: Log at major state-transition decision points using structured `tracing` spans/events. Always include reproducible context (IDs) but NEVER log secrets, tokens, or PII.
- **Concurrency**: Avoid `Arc<Mutex<T>>` lock-contention. Prefer message-passing (channels) or immutable data snapshots to share state across async boundaries.
